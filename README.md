# project based virtual intern : Data Engineer Task 5 Rakamin Academy


# **Project Scenario :**
"A bank manager is expressing concern over the rising trend of customers discontinuing their credit card services. They seek assistance in profiling customers to predict those who are likely to leave their credit card services. This proactive approach will empower the company to reach out to these customers, deliver enhanced services, and positively influence their decisions."

Aligned with the given scenario, this project will predominantly center on elucidating insights regarding the factors contributing to the frequent attrition of credit card customers from credit card services. The primary aim is to lay the groundwork for formulating business strategies designed to retain customers and foster their sustained loyalty to credit card services.

In the execution of this project, there are at least four stages, namely:
1. Determine Business Objectives
2. Data Exploration
3. Insight and Visualization
4. Conclusions and Recommendations
